Pros Of Discrete (The paper method model)
1. Interpretability: The results are easy to understand ("The subject is $90\%$ Happy").
2. Familiarity: Most humans instinctively categorize emotions this way (e.g., "basic emotions" like Happy, Sad, Angry).
3. Direct Task: It directly answers the question, "What specific emotion is the person feeling?"

Cons of the Discrete Model
1. Arbitrary Boundaries: Real-world emotions are rarely distinct categories. How different is "Slightly Happy" from "Content"? The model must force a decision at the boundary.
2. Missing Nuance: The model cannot express how happy, sad, or angry the person is. It loses the intensity information.
3. "Calm" vs. "Neutral" Challenge: As mentioned, emotions like Calm (low arousal, positive/neutral valence) and Neutral (very low arousal, mid-valence) are physiologically very similar. Your model will have a hard time distinguishing them, and a misclassification will be heavily penalized by the loss function, even if the EEG pattern was very close.
4. Limited Scope: You are limited to predicting only the $\mathbf{5}$ classes you've trained on.
